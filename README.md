# Motivation

The motivation for this project was twofold. The majority of my programming experience up to now has been working with desktop applications, game development, and algorithms, mostly through various university assignments. I've been interested in rails development since attending an industry talk on it in 2017 - the streamlined way you can create and deploy apps entirely self-contained to rails was extremly appealing to me.
The second reason I undertook this project was more spontaneous - I was trying to find an online hangman game quickly to play with a friend, but every link I clicked had either died with adobe flash, or was riddled with ads and popups.
I decided to take this opptunity to tackle learning ruby on rails with an achievable goal in mind that might prove useful to some people in the future.
