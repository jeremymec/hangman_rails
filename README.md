# Motivation

The motivation for this project was twofold. The majority of my programming experience up to now has been working with desktop applications, game development, and algorithms, mostly through various university assignments. I've been interested in rails development since attending an industry talk on it in 2017 - the streamlined way you can create and deploy apps without relying on anything but rails was extremly appealing to me.
The second reason I undertook this project was a lot less abstract - I was trying to find a hangman gam quickly to play with a friend, but every link I clicked 




This is my first foray into seeing a web application through to production and has been an invauable learning experience.
